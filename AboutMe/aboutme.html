	<h1>About Joseph M. Best:</h1>
	I have bad eyesight, so I have glasses. I have a deviated septum, so I do nasal sprays, nasal rinses, and I have had 2 nose surgeries, coming up on another. I have Bipolar Disorder, Autism, ADHD, Chronic Migraines, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, all obstacles of mine. But I won't let those stop me from learning more and more, growing stronger in mind and body.
	<br>
	I row crew, for those who don't know what that is, it's "rowing". I have run many 5K and above races in my life, starting when I was 7. This is Joseph McNaught Best speaking. This is me.
