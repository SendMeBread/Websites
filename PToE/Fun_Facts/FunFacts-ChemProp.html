    <ul>
      <li>Helium is the only element discovered with known states of matter that does not have a freezing/condensing point. Yes, Helium <strong>cannot</strong> be a solid.</li>
      <li>Tungsten has the highest melting point of any discovered element, reaching a whopping 3,422 C°. However it does not have the highest boiling point, Rhenium takes the trophy on that one at 5,596 C°.</li>
      <li>The heaviest natural element (as in one atom) is Uranium, with 92 Protons.</li>
      <li>Hydrogen has the smallest number of Isotopes at 3 total, while Xenon and Cesium tie for 1st at a grand total of 36 Isotopes.</li>
    </ul>
